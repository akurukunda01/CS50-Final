# Concordia CS50 Final
#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>
#### Description:
My project was a scannable menu, for customers to use in my made up restraunt, Concordia. The latin word Concordia means harmony, and I named my restraunt after this to show how great the result will be, if the world uses its diversity (in this case food) to work in harmony through different cultures. My restraunt emphasizes this peaceful message, and the webpages created also hope to mimic this theme. The project was coded on a VSCODE repository external to the CS50 codespace, and utilized Flask, Jinja2, and HTML. The website was heavily focused on design and graphic elements, therefore there isn't much backend code, and it is static. As for the contents of the website, the menu, using bootstrap tools like a navbar, to allow the user to toggle between Concordia's diverse food cultures: Asian, Indian, Italian, Middle Eastern, and Mexican. Each culture contains two appetizers and specials. In addition, Concordia's canva created logo is a Lotus, another instance of trying to establish the peaceful theme in our website graphic design. The webiste was deployed through render, which allows it to be viewed publicly. The point of the project is so that when customers get seated at Concordia, to enhance their experience and minimize paper use in menus, they can scan the qr code at their table, and pull up the menu.
